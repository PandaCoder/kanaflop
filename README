kanaflop
========

Webscript that swaps hiragana with katakana and vice-versa, also optionally converts r≈çmaji to either hiragana or katakana.

This webscript is entirely self contained, meaning kanaflop.html contains in-page styling and scripting.

Page styling can be found in the header, and scripting can be found below the HTML footer code.
